[TARGET]
Young student or anyone with a little to no financial literacy.

[PROBLEM]
Most students lack not only the tools to manage their finance but also financial literacy.

[SOLUTION]
I decided to create an app that features a simple expense tracker and a financial assistance platform where short but helpful financial advices are published.

These advices will come:

- The App users: A user will be able to share tips in a twitter-like post (anonymously). Posts whose dislikes outnumber the likes will be deleted.

- Short articles written or approved by an admin.

- Quotes from well-known authors.

- Q & A
